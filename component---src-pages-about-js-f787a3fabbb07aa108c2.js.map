I'm <b>Bruno Opsenica</b> and I've recently decided to try and make my hobby\r\n        of learning about 3D programming and computer graphics into a career. In order to do that, I've created this\r\n        blog as a way of chronicling the things I'm learning about. It's meant to be a mechanism to make my learning\r\n        visible to others, get feedback and (eventually, hopefully) provide help to others if they decide to go down the\r\n        same path. You can see examples of my work on <Link to=\"/projects\">the portfolio page</Link> or in{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/bruop/\">my Github profile.</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I live in Toronto, and work as a software engineer at a startup called <a href=\"https://delphia.com\">Delphia</a>\r\n        . Before that, I worked at the direct precursor of Delphia, <a href=\"https://voxpoplabs.com\">Vox Pop Labs</a>,\r\n        where I got an opportunity to build a few different interactive data visualizations, like{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"http://votecompass.com\">Vote Compass</a> and <a href=\"https://echoes.cbc.ca\">Echoes</a>\r\n        <sup>1</sup>.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        Before that, I attended the University of Toronto where I specialized in Physics and graduated in 2012. It was\r\n        while taking courses on fluid mechanics and geophysics that I discovered my love of programming, and a fourth\r\n        year course in computer graphics sealed my fate.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        I'm currently looking for work as a graphics programmer!
