I've recently decided to try and make my hobby of learning about 3D programming and computer\r\n        graphics into a career. In order to do that, I've created this blog as a way of chronicling the things I'm\r\n        learning about. It's meant to be a mechanism to make my learning visible to others, get feedback and\r\n        (eventually, hopefully) provide help to others if they decide to go down the same path.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I live in Toronto, and work as a software engineer at a startup called <a href=\"https://delphia.com\">Delphia</a>\r\n        . Before that, I worked at the direct precursor of Delphia, <a href=\"https://voxpoplabs.com\">Vox Pop Labs</a>,\r\n        where I got an opportunity to build a few different interactive data visualizations, like{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"http://votecompass.com\">Vote Compass</a> and <a href=\"https://echoes.cbc.ca\">Echoes</a>\r\n        <sup>1</sup>.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        Before that, I attended the University of Toronto where I specialized in Physics and graduated in 2012. It was\r\n        while taking courses on fluid mechanics and geophysics that I discovered my love of programming, and a fourth\r\n        year course in computer graphics sealed my fate.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>[1] Not sure how long this link will actually stay up!</p>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default AboutMe;\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
